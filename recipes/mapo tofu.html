            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This mapo tofu recipe (麻婆豆腐) is the true blue, authentic real deal—the spicy, tongue-numbing, rice-is-absolutely-not-optional, can’t-have-just-one-scoop mapo tofu that you get in the restaurants. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                Mapo Tofu is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan Province, where spicy food is king and the signature spice of the region––the Sichuan Peppercorn––gives dishes a unique “numbing” effect. It’s almost like the Sichuan peppercorns are there to not only add their fragrance and flavor, but also to numb your tongue so it can take more heat!
            </p>

            <p>
                The name of the dish roughly translates to “pockmarked grandma’s tofu.” Whatever its origins, mapo tofu has made it out of Sichuan Province and spread around the world. The dish has taken on many forms as restaurants and takeout joints have put their own spin on it, often lessening spice levels, adding different vegetables, and transforming the dish into something else entirely!

            <h3>Avoiding Sichuan peppercorn overload</h3>
            <p>
                Sichuan peppercorns vary widely in quality (and in numbing strength). Since I first posted this recipe way way way back in 2014, Sichuan peppercorns have entered the mainstream, which means it’s a lot easier to find fresh, high-quality ones. Also my cooking equipment got a lot more advanced (I used to smash my peppercorns in a zip loc bag with a rolling pin in my cramped college apartment kitchen).
            </p>

            <p>
                That said, the fresher the peppercorns, the more powerful their numbing effect will be. If your peppercorns are extremely fresh or high quality, you should consider reducing the amount of peppercorns within the range we call for in this recipe according to your own tastes!
            </p>

            <p>
                What’s more, some folks over the years complain of bitterness. I’ve realized over the years that the reason is threefold:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Some peppercorns are lower quality and come with a bitter black seed. Definitely avoid those! <strong>The husk is where the flavor is.</strong></li>
                <li>The second cause for bitterness is accidentally burning your Sichuan peppercorns during the frying process. Err on the side of caution there — <strong>we’ve updated the recipe to add the peppercorns in after the cooked pork is already in the wok</strong> (see <strong>Step 2</strong> of the recipe card).</li>
                <li>At some point, more peppercorns, yes, will result in a stronger numbing sensation (which we know some of you all are junkies for), but can also give the dish a stronger more herbal and bitter undertone. <strong>If you want a milder Sichuan peppercorn flavor, you can start off with as little as 1/2 teaspoon to 1 teaspoon.</strong></li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>½ cup oil (divided)</li>
                <li>1-2 fresh Thai bird chili peppers (thinly sliced)</li>
                <li>6-8 dried red chilies (roughly chopped)</li>
                <li>1/2- 1 1/2 tablespoons Sichuan peppercorns (powdered or finely ground, reserving 1/4 teaspoon for garnish at the end; if you want a milder flavor use 1/2 or 1 teaspoon ground Sichuan peppercorn)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons ginger (finely minced)</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons garlic (finely minced)</li>
                <li>8 ounces ground pork</li>
                <li>1-2 tablespoons spicy bean sauce (depending on your desired salt/spice levels)</li>
                <li>2/3 cup low sodium chicken broth (or water)</li>
                <li>1 pound silken tofu (cut into 1 inch/2.5cm cubes)</li>
                <li>1/4 cup water</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon sesame oil (optional)</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon sugar (optional)</li>
                <li>1 scallion (finely chopped)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First, we toast the chilies. If you have homemade toasted chili oil, you can skip this step. Heat your wok or a small saucepan over low heat. Add half of the oil and throw in the fresh and dried peppers. Stir occasionally and heat until fragrant, about 5 minutes, ensuring that the peppers don’t burn. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat the remaining half of the oil in your wok over medium heat. Add the ginger. After 1 minute, add the garlic. Fry for another minute, and then turn up the heat to high and add the ground pork. Break up the meat and fry it until it’s cooked through. Add your ground Sichuan peppercorns and stir for about 15-30 seconds, taking care to not let it burn, as it will turn bitter if it does.</li>
                <li>Add the spicy bean sauce to the mixture and stir it in well. Add the chicken broth to the wok and stir. Let this simmer for a minute or so. While that's happening, ready your tofu and combine the water and cornstarch in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Add the cornstarch mixture to your sauce and stir. Let it bubble away until the sauce starts to thicken. (If it gets too thick, splash in a little more water or chicken stock.)</li>
                <li>Then add your chili oil from before—peppers and all! If you are using homemade chili oil, ONLY use the standing oil, as it's likely that you have salted it and you only want the oil, not additional salt. Stir the oil into the sauce, and add the tofu. Use your spatula to gently toss the tofu in the sauce. Let everything cook for 3-5 minutes. Add the sesame oil and sugar (if using) along with the scallions and stir until the scallions are just wilted.</li>
                <li>Serve with a last sprinkle of Sichuan peppercorn powder as a garnish if desired.</li>
